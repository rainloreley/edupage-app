# edupage

This folder handles the communication between the app and Edupage.
It's using a fork of the original project to make it work with the App (e.g. Secure Storage).

## Update: this probably won't work

Check [LoginView.tsx](https://github.com/rainloreley/edupage-app/blob/efa77fada31243c8c6527a4eb90ed708dc2536bf/views/login/LoginView.tsx#L53) for more information (comment included).
